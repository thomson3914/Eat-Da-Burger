### Description

    A full stack application with the front end implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and the back end with Node.js and Express. Data is stored in a MySQL database. HTML templating is done handled with the use of Handlebars.

    The user may enter any burger of choice to add it to the menu or select *Order Again* from the *Previous Order*. This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as *Ready!* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
