### 🍔Description
Bumpin Burgers demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express.  HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter a burger of choice to add it to the *Order*. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. This burger is added as *Ready!* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then *Eat* any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the *Previous Orders* column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
The burgers in the *Previous Orders* can also be ordered again.

Further improvements could be made by adding a *Delete* button to clean up the *Previous Orders* column.
