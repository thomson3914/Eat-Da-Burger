### 🍔Description
Bumpin Burgers is a simple full stack application. 
1. The front end is implemented with HTML.
2. The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.  
3. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

### 🍔Instructions
1. The user may *Order* a new burger or choose to *Re-Order* from the *Previous Orders*.
2. This adds the burger of choice into the MySQL database.   
3. Eat the burger by clicking *Eat It!* in the *Ready* column.
4. This moves it into the *Previous Orders* column and updates its status accordingly in the database.

### 🍔Improvements

Further improvements could be made by adding a *Delete* button to clean up the *Previous Orders* column.
The functionality of the page needs to be optimized. Also the graphic takes up space at the top of the page. 
This causes a lot of scrolling to get to the burger information.
