### 🍔Description
Bumpin Burgers demonstrates a simple full stack application. The front end is implemented with HTML and the backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.  HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may *Order* a new burger or choose to *Re-Order* from the *Previous Orders*. This adds the burger of choice into the MySQL database. This burger is also added as *Ready!* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then *Eat* a burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the *Previous Orders* column and updates its status accordingly in the database.

Further improvements could be made by adding a *Delete* button to clean up the *Previous Orders* column.
