### 🍔Description
* Bumpin Burgers is a simple full stack application. 
* The front end is implemented with HTML.
* The backend is implemented with Node.js and Express.  
* HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

### 🍔Instructions
1. The user may *Order* a new burger or choose to *Re-Order* from the *Previous Orders*.
2. This adds the burger of choice into the MySQL database.   
3. Eat the burger by clicking *Eat It!* in the *Ready* column.
4. This moves it into the *Previous Orders* column and updates its status accordingly in the database.

### 🍔Improvements

Further improvements could be made by adding a *Delete* button to clean up the *Previous Orders* column.
 The functionality of the page needs to be optimized.  The Bumpin Burger gif takes up space at the top of the page. 
This causes a excessive scrolling to get to the burger information at the bottom of the page.
